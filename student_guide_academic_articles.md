# A quick student guide to reading/evaluating academic journal articles (in finance/economics)

## Draft!

Reflecting my personal views and recommendations for students trying to get to grips with academic journal articles for the first time (or so).

### Quality of source

How can we actually ensure that the article we are considering is actually of sufficient quality? This is one of the hardest  questions right at the start, 
in particular for students with little prior knowledge in the discipline. And it continues to be a challenge even for experienced researchers.

> These checks and considerations are not perfect, and possibly disadvantage / discard valid academic sources just because they don't meet the
> criteria. With academic publishing practices changing, you will have to adapt your approach and keep an open mind.
